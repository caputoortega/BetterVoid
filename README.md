## What is it?

Just a simple Minecraft Spigot-based plugin (also works in Bukkit/CraftBukkit and other forks) that adds a bit of fun 
to the act of falling into the void in the end dimension.

## Compile dependencies

 - `spigot 1.18.2`
 - Based on Java JDK 17.0.1

 I haven't tested it with other Spigot nor JDK versions but it might work.
